### Title: "Vyrams reikia daug sekso ir kad moteris būtų graži": kilo pasipiktinimo banga dėl vyrų organizacijos „Gentys" veiklos

**("Men need a lot of sex and for women to be beautiful": outrage wave arose over the activities of men's organization "Gentys")**

### Lead

"Mes nekritikuojame tradicinio vyriškumo, dėl to natūralu, kad atrodome kaip dalis tų radikalų" ("We don't criticize traditional masculinity, so it's natural that we appear as part of those radicals"), – states psychologist Antanas Grižas, head of the organization "Gentys" that provides psychological help to men. 

In the public space, there are various observations about this organization: while some share and celebrate the help provided by the organization, others don't understand why controversial statements about women and masculinity are heard in "Gentys" organized activities and events.

### Background Context

Recently, in the Facebook group "Feminizmas" (Feminism), there has been plenty of criticism directed at the "Gentys" organization, as a slide has spread in the public sphere where the organization shared men's advice to women. These pieces of advice, which claim that men "need a lot of sex," that this "is a source of security in relationships," or that it's important for them that "women be beautiful," and if a man is in a relationship, he supposedly "can't even notice another woman's cleavage," caused quite significant outrage.

After the organization's festival "Gentys Fest," various assessments were also heard that traditional masculinity is promoted in the organization, and signs of sexism can be observed in the organization's activities.

## Interview with Antanas Grižas: "We try to defend men's dignity, we don't blame them"

When TV3.lt news portal contacted "Gentys" leader Antanas Grižas, he claimed that criticism arrows are thrown toward "Gentys" from time to time because their activities are associated with radical men's movements and historical past when patriarchal society prevailed.

### The Controversial Slide

**Q:** On social networks, discussions about the "Gentys" organization can be observed, and there's quite a bit of discussion about possible manifestations of sexism in your activities. A slide you created has just spread, sharing quite controversial men's advice to women. You defended yourself under this post, saying the slide was taken out of context - how did it end up on the internet and what was the purpose of creating this slide?

**A:** I created that slide myself. This was, if I'm not mistaken, in 2022, but I might be wrong. I was invited by a women's community to an online event where I would tell women about men.

Preparing for that event, I asked men on the "Gentys" online platform what advice or wishes they would give to women. What was written down, I put together.

When the event started, I emphasized that this is in no way the organization's position. I was simply asked to tell at the event what men live by, how women can help men, what men expect from women. I wanted to present real examples, discuss them, and not just tell everything theoretically.

During that event, there were very different reactions among the same women, of course, there was much indignation and discussions. I immediately saw it was a mistake to include that slide and I wouldn't do it now for various reasons. First of all, these were individual men's positions, which are sharp.

I even put a photo from "Gentys" photoshoot with our faces in that slide, so it looked like our organization's position, it couldn't look otherwise. It seemed like we teach men this, although that's not the case.

I honestly say it was such a communication mistake.

### Timeline and Spread

**Q:** This happened in 2022, but this slide is spreading now.

**A:** At that time, someone took a screenshot of this slide and it kept popping up somewhere, discussions about this kept arising. Recently it spread, of course, I can't say exactly, but I think it's because the news portal "Gyvenimas per brangus" wrote a very critical, sensational review about our organized festival. They used that slide there.

Since their article received great attention, that's probably why discussions arose again.

### Festival Criticism

**Q:** I read that article about your organized festival, there really wasn't lacking criticism that traditional masculinity is emphasized in your organized activities. By the way, the festival host even said, I quote: "You can't tell anymore where's the man, where's the woman, and they live unhappy and blame each other." How do you evaluate such statements by your event host?

**A:** This was not agreed with the host Marius Šmitas in advance, he shared his personal opinion and position, this is not our position. This is not "Gentys" position. When that introductory part of the event ended, I took him aside and said: "Hey, we don't talk like that, we in 'Gentys' don't talk about masculinities, femininities, we don't teach masculinity, this is not a masculinity school."

We want to create space for men to safely explore their emotional world. This is our aspiration, not to teach how to be masculine or more masculine or what is masculine. We've been communicating this from the very beginning, it's also written on our website.

But since we work with men, they often confuse this themselves and think this is about masculinity.

### Core Activities

**Q:** What topics are most commonly addressed in those activities, meetings, if you say you don't talk about masculinity?

**A:** We don't say we don't talk about masculinity, we just don't teach what masculinity is, we're not a school. We're not some university where theory or practice is taught on how to become more masculine. We help develop emotional literacy and intelligence skills.

Our main activity is forming self-help groups, we call these self-help groups "gentys" (tribes), one tribe has up to ten people. We form that group and our facilitator conducts introductory 8 meetings, and later the tribe has already learned how to function, so it operates independently.

During those introductory meetings, they learn meeting structure, how to listen to and communicate with each other non-violently, how to give feedback to others, how to delve into their emotions and talk about their emotions.

Then team strengthening exercises are done so the tribe would be more connected as a team, as a group. We teach how to share about life difficulties, how to support others.

When men start sharing, we don't want to and can't censor them, the vast majority of them talk about romantic relationships or relationships with their parents. I mean, like with a psychologist, very often topics still drift to relationships with mom, dad, various hurts about that. There's also talk about fatherhood and about life's meaning, because many feel meaninglessness, claim work is meaningless or think about suicide and similar things.

### Understanding the Criticism

**Q:** Why do you think people's outrage about your activities arises? Why are questions raised about statements made at your organization's organized events or visualizations you use?

**A:** I can understand, partly understand, but not necessarily justify that hostility. First of all, it arises from historical past, patriarchalism, which was based on men gathering alone, not letting women in, and establishing their own rules, deciding society's issues themselves. Here, of course, I said it very simplistically. If men gather, it raises associations with patriarchalism.

Another thing is that especially now in the world there are radical men's movements, especially in the online space. Various portals, forums exist where men share grievances, anger and quite radical thoughts, there's a lot of hatred toward women, society, feminism is seen as a great evil. Those men have very big traumas and resort to radical actions, violence, attacks.

In that context, I can understand that there's natural suspicion toward us, because we are a men's organization, we try to defend men's dignity, we don't blame them, we don't rush to talk about men being abusers, we don't criticize traditional masculinity, so it's natural that we appear as part of those radicals.

### Why Men-Only Groups?

**Q:** How do you evaluate some people's view that such single-gender meetings are sexist? Why does a man need to be only among men?

**A:** All those radical movements didn't arise from nowhere, from having nothing to do. Those movements arose from pain, men feel misunderstood and still can't find answers and recognition of their suffering. There are many difficulties that women experience, but there are also many difficulties that men experience, which we don't talk about enough.

Then men find refuge in those radical groups, which are also not the answer, because there many with grievances, traumatic experiences, after painful divorces and other things, without expert help, they reinforce each other's wounds instead of healing them.

But for me, this is a sign that men need help, men need space. It's clear from scientific research and practice that for many men it's safest to start opening up, revealing their emotions in other men's space. They feel safer there, not all, there are exceptions and differences, there are those who successfully go to therapy. But for the average man, therapy isn't attractive, accessible, available or understandable.

For them, talking with other men is more attractive, then they can start talking about various things and we see this in our groups. Men come to us who otherwise wouldn't go to a psychologist, and after these activities, going to a specialist doesn't seem so scary to them.

Our organization's position is that instead of blaming men for not going to a psychologist, create a service that's more convenient for them to use and more convenient to take care of their emotional health.

Viskas labai gerai geniu atstovai, bet ar jus sudarysite sąlygas tam kad moteris nedirbtu, skirtu laiko savo grazinimi ir poilsiui kad galva neskaudetu?????? Manau tai tikrai jums nepakeliama bus našta, nes atrodote kaip nevykeliai

Pries 100 metu,vakaruose dirbo tik vyrai ir to pilnai uztekdavo seimai islaikyti bei pasiturinciai gyventi.Tada masonai sugalvojo ir paskleide moteru teises,feminizmus ir panasu suda,sukele pora Pasauliniu karu,kad truktu vyru ir idarbino moteris.Dabar jau seimose dirba abu,daznai ir per kelis darbus,bet tikrai negyvena turtingiau,nei pries 100 metu,kai dirbo tik vyrai.Uz tai masonu turtai,padvigubejums jiems turtus nesanciu darbuotoju,isaugo kaip ant mieliu.

*Translation: 100 years ago, in the West only men worked and that was fully enough to support a family and live prosperously. Then freemasons came up with and spread women's rights, feminisms and similar shit, caused a couple of World Wars so that men would be lacking and employed women. Now both work in families, often multiple jobs, but certainly don't live more prosperously than 100 years ago when only men worked. Because of this, freemasons' wealth, having doubled their wealth from unpaid workers, grew like yeast.*

Ir as pasipiktinau. Is tikruju, vyrams sekkso visai nereikia. Ir nereikia, kad moterys butu grazios. Beje, liaudies ismintis teigia- jei vyriskis kulturingas, jam b***s nereikalingas:)

Kad per ta seksa daug problemu, galimas nestumas, lpl, o kur po kiekvieno sekso kylantis uzdegimam, pienelignes, vaginozes, kurios atsiranda per vyrus. Moteris neturi sekso, tai ji neserga ligom, o tos, kurios turi vyrus, tai is ginekologu neiseina.Vyrai nera grazus nuogi, jie prakaituoja, smirdi, plaukuoti, seilejasi, jiems skirda is burnos, nemoka net krutus tinkamai liesti, kai kurie per greit baigia, nori moters, kuri viska darytu pati, nepadeda buity, rupi tik lakimas, vartojimas su tokiais pat nevykeliais draugais, negalvoja apie ateiti, nerimti. Kam moteriai turinciai darba, namus vyras, kad atnestu ginekologiniu ligu, skausma, depresija, smurta, nerima i moters gyvenima. Geriausia, kai nutuke su pilvais begemotai modeliu nori, arba nupiepia kudi, lyg distrofikai nori modeliu.

*Translation: Because through that sex there are many problems, possible pregnancy, STDs, and where after every sex arising inflammations, urinary tract infections, vaginosis, which arise through men. A woman doesn't have sex, then she doesn't get sick, but those who have men, they don't leave gynecologists. Men aren't beautiful naked, they sweat, stink, are hairy, drool, their breath stinks, they don't even know how to properly touch breasts, some finish too quickly, want a woman who would do everything herself, don't help in household, only care about drinking, consuming with similar loser friends, don't think about future, aren't serious. Why would a woman who has work, home need a man to bring gynecological diseases, pain, depression, violence, anxiety into woman's life. Best when fat hippos with bellies want models, or skinny dystrophics want models.*
