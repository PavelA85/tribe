very valuable

like to present and Thomas grijes a

clinical psychologist

[Music]

Creator and founder of the project

tribes

as a person

who puts all his effort

in what he believes in and it's

very important that he believes in the

well-being of Lithuanian men

and we are happy to be here

his ideas about the work which is

gaining momentum hello to everybody

thank you said for the introduction

hello to the most patient participant

who have waited until the end

I'm happy to be here to speak about our

work we are proud of it I think that we

are contributing to the prevention of

suicides among men in this video I'm

very happy about this part of our

conference now I will share the screen

with you

we will be speaking about the project

tribes and everything that is related to

tribes

I will speak about myself about my

context

I'm a clinical psychologist

I worked with suicide prevention

previously I participated in the

kupishkis project I work in the youth

line youth hotline

I was a board member in the crisis

Management Center

I am a lecture lecturer in assist

foreign

some lessons that I have learned learned

it is very important to base everything

on the research of the science in

interventions and in the prevention of

suicide it is also very important to

apply the knowledge on the social level

I could to work with my knowledge

personally but it's very important to

work socially so the copicious project

the youth hotline and assist these

projects are very important and they

mean in the sense that we can work in a

social way I also have learned that you

can rely on your community and enable

your community with a psychologists can

be the enablers of communities

I have had the psychologists who were

authorities for for me and and I also

learned from these projects that to me

to men it also hurts we psychologists

don't have haven't known what to do with

that for very many years what will I be

speaking today

I will be speaking about the general

scientific basis on men's psychology The

Villa has said something about that I

will continue on the same line I will

also speak about men movement Globe

movement globally and I will speak about

the tribes project our methodology

challenges opportunities our vision and

I will also speak about our

lessons learned

and afterwards

[Music]

um

do men from our project will speak about

their

experiences first of all the different

views on the male Mental Health

I can affirm that male mental health is

a controversial topic there is no one

view on it

there is a topic that arises much of

much emotions I've been working in

suicide prevention for a decade or more

but the suicide topic is not such an

emotional topic compared to the gender

topic it's because all of us have agenda

we have a mother and a father we have

some

but um

some points that are difficult to us but

this topic is very important for

everybody

there are like two camps

the earlier approach

that

a pet not so

long ago

and the 90s in the USA

um

a group was founded to work with men

psychology

and as the Villa has said uh

psychology of the American psychology

Association based everything on the

feminism that was thriving at that time

they based everything on the gender

studies on the critical theory Theory

and they looked at the social influence

and the stereotypes and they didn't care

so much about the psychology they spoke

about the um about how does mass

humidity harm men and society and how to

help men free themselves from the

traditional masculinity and the Villa

has said that

these stereotype these gender roles so

in the USA they spoke about how to go

away from that and this trend is now

called as a deficient approach because

the masculinity is something that should

be changed that something that is

something that you should be free from

I have found an example on an

illustration of this approach

uh these are the um

aims of this Association

to encourage a critical approach on how

the social uh gender forms and limits uh

the male life

help to um

be completely to to to to work all the

potential and to uh give away walk away

with the

limiting

definitions of masculinity

Etc you can see here that the American

psychology Association didn't have a

neutral

um unbiased

approach to masculinity

[Music]

they were

they were basing themselves on the

feminism and other disciplines very

popular then

and a couple of years ago this

Association published guidelines for

psychological practice with boys and men

everybody was looking forward to this to

these guidelines but then they were

received in a very controversial way

because

foreign

you can find things very different from

other guidelines in this topic much of

bias and political issues are there in

these guidelines things that

psychologists would like to um

to put aside in their work so these

guidelines are considered as very

controversial

guidelines

uh the other approach she started

developing in the UK in the year 2011.

in the community of male psychologists

they wanted to learn from the deficient

approach and to complement it and here

we can find the

psychology that is more known for US

based on the science on the research on

humanistic evolutional

uh knowledge

and the focus

was considering that the masculinity was

approached as something very critical

now the approach was ethical towards

gender

it is very important not to

um

exercise any discrimination on base of

gender religion

and other issues

so if a person is a man and identifies

himself as a man

we shouldn't have a critical view on

this person

we should speak not only about

similarities of the genders not only

about the social differences but also

about the biological differences having

a holistic approach on that

so what are the needs the unique needs

of men and boys and how does this help

to understand women and other genders

so this approach is called the positive

approach

it is nice that the American

psychologist Association have changed

the goals of the working group and

having and have

um

and now they do not have these uh the

previous goals among their aims

all the community of male psychologists

are very happy and now the British

psychological Society has published also

guidelines psychological interventions

uh on male adults I will do my best to

translate the these

guidelines into Lithuanian so that our

society has access to the to this

publication there are some good books on

male psychology for example on the left

hand side perspectives in male

psychology and introduction

uh we in the frame of framework of our

project to the tribes have uh bought

quite a number of books

and we have

given some of some of them

um to the major libraries in Lithuania

if you want to know more about it you

can read this book

male experiences

I will be speaking about tribes in

depths later but now I will say that the

bio psychosocial approach is very

important for the tribes

we always have a say that we have a

gender unique experiences

at both the biological psychological and

social level it is very important to

talk about that for male and males and

for females or women and for men it is

very important to speak about these

experiences with the same gender

if we don't speak about these

experiences we we have a negative effect

we can be ashamed we can be we can feel

um that we don't understand what

happened to us we don't know what to do

in different situations

here we have

uh

these different

experiences biology on the one hand and

culture on the other hand there's always

a discussion how much nature or biology

and how much culture is there in the in

our experiences we shouldn't speak only

about biology or only about culture

because culture is created by people who

are

um human beings the biological items

but I have tried to make some kind of

list of male experiences

it would be the sexual life we have

different genitals

different pubic sense different sexual

arousal the masturbation is a very

different

inexperience for sexual experiences

caused by dreams importance and other

biological problems prostate cancer

these are unique male experiences that

should be talked about

other things are the psychological

things for for example

um the

hyperactivity of men uh the

[Music]

um

that boys

or word choice these are things that we

do not usually think about that

we are in the middle

for example the attraction to different

gender the courtship

flirting how to create the relationship

how to initiate a relationship the

sexual life of a couple

and getting the news about pregnancy

relationship when the wife is pregnant

being a father

when a man does not know if the child is

his child

foreign

there's a problem in all the countries

this hormone is very important for the

cognitive

possibilities of a man and for the

health in general the war what we are

facing a war now

um mobilization drafting it's usually

drafting of men in major countries

understanding expressing emotions

what we can see from the research

we could not say that men

are poorer in expressing or

understanding emotions it's a stereotype

it's usually uh something from the

nature and something from your childhood

we also have

punishments for crimes the punishments

for misbehavior which are much harder

than punishments for women we can also

say that the relationship with the

father for a boy is a very different and

for a girl and

if there is no father a boy will suffer

more than a girl so these are

unique

experiences there's also a syndrome

called Failure to Launch

is that young man

who cannot go to

the next stage of their life after the

teenage stage they can they cannot do a

career cannot leave parents house

it's too complicated for them they stay

at the parents house they start they

start abusing of alcohol and this

phenomena is a very important phenomena

now in the Western World I don't know

how it is called in Lithuania but

it's Failure to Launch in English and

then we have cultural things different

um

different childhood to no more

this

divorce is the family law

um

Falls following or false sexual abuse

stereotypes gender roles that are

changing

finish these are things that should be

talked about and also the contrast

stereotypes but the traditional uh

masculinity is bad or toxic this is also

a stereotype that makes a very huge

influence

which is very important to take into

consideration both the experience of men

and women and today in the public we are

so much focused on stereotypes and the

cultural impacts while the biological

issues

are Taboo in our societies therefore

this taboo has to be overcome and we

should be speaking about our differences

today we are not sufficiently speaking

about the unique experiences among men

of men they have many

needs and questions to which they

publicly do not necessarily get replies

therefore

I would like to speak about the men's

movements which are not very well known

but they are worldwide and they may be

very significant in the public

we have such a

time the manosphere men's sphere it

appeared

in the internet

when the internet appeared in the

previous Century men started talking to

each other in various forum

and they did that anonymously

about what they cannot speak

publicly and they started sharing the

topics that in America as a result of

the feminist movement to certain topics

were taboo however this movement is only

growing although in some places these

four are prohibited and called sex

sexist or hate speech

but they find a place elsewhere then

because men

have the need to speak about the unique

experiences they encounter that's why

they go get United this is why I want to

speak about that because the Young

Generation of men

really get involved in this movement and

they watch YouTube they see and they

they observe that

internet they know English and they want

to know what is happening in the world

and this is one branch we have one

branch of this movement these are pickup

artists

men who actually try to

um

to find a girl to be able to get a

relationship into a relationship with a

girl a lady and can't you imagine how

many bad things are being taught there

now there are so many disrespectful

things emotionally not very good skills

being taught but at the same time it has

good things plenty of good things but

this is kind of underground nobody can

regulate that so things happen over

there

many people

are interested in that because they have

this needs they have the lack of

emotional and sexual intimacy at the

lack of social skills to get into a

relationship and they are looking for

replies and they find these movements

various training and Lithuanian men do

the same then we have the red pill

this is to put it simple The

evolutionary

attitude of psychological attitudes

towards relationship they try to have a

scientific approach towards that but

because this is underground there are

um there's there's lots of

pseudoscience there and sexism and but

many men discover that and they start

reading not necessarily adopt the proper

attitude but of course there are also

very good very many good things there

because

publicly there's very little talk about

evolutionary differences among men and

women more more and more we hear about

stereotypes but when men need to find

something they find it and they're a

disturbing branch is in cells in

involuntary celibate that is Young lads

who are isolated

lack social skills uh various socially

concerned maybe they have traumas and

they experience so much pain that they

do not have sexual intimacy and they

have so much anger in them

and there have been a few cases in the

U.S when a few

young Lads belonging to their insults

Community uh committed suicide before

after shooting their dead and shooting

and killing there yes

and they get into that group because

they do not get answers from the public

discourse that's why I wanted to talk to

you about these movements if we want to

help men we have to understand how they

take care of their emotional health

health how they solve their questions

it's important

to understand them

and important is that all those

discussions underway in various groups

they have to get out from the

underground into the public domain and

then we would keep a constructive

conversation we could speak about

relationships about the emotional and

social isolation we could speak about

both cultural

and impacts and stereotypes and

gender differences and these topics

should be legal and should be publicly

discussed and we would like to invite we

the tribes would like to invite men to

discuss about that and we would like to

safeguard them from

going to the extreme

and this is uh just an example that

those young Lads sometimes start

shooting down their colleagues their

friends

usually these are teenagers who haven't

had a father in their childhood and they

have a experience and big eyes social

isolation that was an introduction now I

will speak about uh the tribes

I will speak uh

on my personal side

here you can see me when I was seven

years old with a monkey at school

how do I remember myself

this topic the masculinity and male

identity topic is very important for me

I remember that in my childhood

I experienced some violence both the

physical and emotional from our my

schoolmates and also at home

and I liked a male

example I had three elderly Elder

sisters

and when they would come back with a

boyfriend

home I wanted to spend some time with

his boyfriend because it was

it was a

man with whom I wanted to spend some

time I love my father but I but he was

like some kind of absent in my family

it was not clear for me what does it

mean to be a man when I was a child I

used to hear that is that I'm very

emotional and that I'm depressive and

when I saw that my parents were arguing

I decided to be uh different

my mother was for me good

a person who should I should care and my

father was the bad man my family so I

decided to be different

here you can see me

28 years old I don't remember why I did

this photo

I had to just

let from a long-term relationship where

it got terminated and it was very

painful and it was not the past

relationship that I failed and I was

worried because I was 20 years old and I

was at a loss I was wondering what was

happening to me and I was a psychologist

at that time already and I thought maybe

I lack some attachment or some maybe I

have some personality disorder or a

depression actually I was reading lots

of literature and trying to diagnose

myself but could not find the reply what

did I start doing I actually started

researching in YouTube in Reddit and I

started trying to find replies behind

psychology and I found many videos where

men share their experiences experience

what it means to share to create

relationship with women and they did

that absolutely differently the things

that I never heard

at the University and it was an

eye-opener I received lots of practical

information which actually helped me

develop of course there were many

nonsense things because internet is full

of nonsense and erroneous things as well

but I also found many men who convinced

me whom I trusted and whose values were

acceptable to me and that helped me a

lot to move forward

but I got tired of doing that via

YouTube

of listening to men who are on the other

side of the Atlantic and I started

hearing the term find your tribe

this is the time used in personal

development area I was lucky that in a

month in a year I was able to discover

such a tribe and a group of men started

getting together regularly an

acquaintance offered that we should get

together and we started meeting started

talking about our experience

about our sexuality and about many other

things like health and and so on and I

started feeling that

actually at that time I was already

doing lots of psychotherapy but I

started feeling absolutely different in

that group I started talking about

things in that group started taking off

my mask social mask

sociologist's mask

I found friends

um dudes with whom I started eating the

ice cream together talking on the street

and I started feeling that

this is my backup which helps me move

forward in life

a couple of years later together with a

member of My Tribe

details decided to help other men create

such tribes and try to see how this

model works and I felt that I really

want to work with men

I realized that if this hope which is if

this area which is neglected helps me it

should help others this pilot project

worked and uh there were two more men

from

describe one marketing specialist

another lawyer who wanted to join this

uh project and we started developing the

project tribes establishing men's groups

and at the moment we have this

organization which is very much

established for a long time it looks

like and they are acting doing serious

things in 2.5 years

we have had 1 300 men who participated

in the tribal activity we have

there are over 130 tribes in Lithuania

and abroad and

people the men the men assess that they

feel happier by 30 percent on average to

compare their life before and after

the tribal movement and if we can

imagine that before the tribes

in Lithuania there used to be

very few psychological therapeutic

groups in Lithuania but now all the year

round

30 or more groups like that start their

activities this is a huge change and we

are so delighted that this is happening

because we wanted to make Psychological

Services

accessible to me to to men attractive to

men every year we have 30 new tribes

with at least 10 participants I think

this is a splendid results

we cooperate with the state as well

Public Health bureaus

bought our services we hope to continue

cooperation with them and this helps men

uh participate in this in these groups

free of charge now we have men's welfare

forum

and we they represent uh men's welfare

publicly okay so what are the tribes

like how do we work

this is a men's self-development group

consisting of six to ten men they share

their responsibilities and they meet

officially and they focus on getting to

know themselves and feedback and

violence free communication with each

other and personal development tribes

are a community a community

involving many tribes and what is what

is what is the

the activity of the tribe it is only

natural that

um

men have to be selected and then we form

the tribe and then men have to undergo

the course of a tribe this is this is a

two-month process where they develop

their social

um skills and uh

they are trained how they can continue

meeting independently without a

moderator

this is very important because you

cannot assign a psychologist for every

group if you want this movement to

spread and after this course the tribe

continues to get our support from the

overall organization we help them with

various

trainings and events and then there is a

community that has various thematic

foreign

facilitators that is men who lead new

tribes we train them according

methodology and then they

um have new tribes and they develop

themselves both in terms of leadership

or emotional skills or social skills

this is a good way to realize themselves

I can't say this is

but this is not really a volunteering

because they receive some remuneration

then we have the event moderator uh for

instance if there is a tribe of men

wanting to lose weight they meet with

the moderator or there is a group that

of men who experience divorce then they

have a moderator in the topic of divorce

uh how does it how does the preparation

of an independent tribe look like this

is a course of eight months

the first

month is getting to know each other

second month is internal work how

um one can do the the work safely three

personal objectives for emotions with

five feedback and

conflict management six play

then we start speaking about the future

of the tribe and expectations and at the

end every man will decide whether they

want to

um

stay in the tribe or others decide that

it's not for them

and they choose the name of that tribe

and continue living independently in

between those meetings there are

one-to-one meetings with their tribes

peers

are getting to know each other and then

they get some individual training on how

to continue at the meetings because

every participant mod is moderated by

the men themselves yeah every time

it is a different participant

and the moderators only helped to manage

that then we have

the community behind all that what does

a typical tribe meeting look like

at every typical tribe meeting we have a

few responsibilities the owner who

structures the time then the moderator

that chooses

as an exercise that they will moderate

we start the sessions with mindfulness

with grounding so that people switch on

to a different regime and join the group

and registration where every man shares

what they have come with then 10 minutes

for the review of the weekly objectives

and discussions

then we have the exercise for instance

active listening or

speaking about fathers or reflecting on

their bodies

then 40 minutes of internal work where a

man will ask for his or for some time to

discuss a painful situation or their

question in life and other men help them

with that and then preparation for

another meeting and 15 minutes for the

registration

that is they say some concluding words

and then some ritual concluding ritual

and in a week we will meet again and

this is up to three hours

so what is our long-term strategy

The Who

[Music]

has developed the mental health services

model

where do I see the tribes in this model

the model

has a pricey and cheap services and it's

the cheap services that are needed most

the most important issue is taking care

of yourself what we can do ourselves

without ourselves without Health

Specialists and this is very empowering

going forward in formal community help

many people need it and these issues are

informal Services where people

participate for instance stress

relaxation skills meditation skills

sports you know emotional skills and

community help and then

the primary psychological and

psychiatric help

assistance and then hospitalization that

is the tertiary

assistance the men avoid participating

in those formal services and are willing

to participate in the informal services

so this is what the tribes need

according to the statistics the largest

number of suicides is among elderly men

in rural areas or districts because

professional help is least accessible

for them

so that's why they needed these tribal

Services we are changing the culture

because more and more people speak about

that and in this way we change the

culture we act preventively and are

moving forward

what else happens in tribes when we

notice people who need more who uh to

whom the tribes are not enough this is

positive experience for them to see that

other men go visit

psychologists too you take

antidepressants okay maybe this is no

problem maybe this maybe I will start

taking them too maybe this is nothing

scary so this um is

our objective to collect uh to direct

the people who really need official

assistance and do that so what do we

learn in tribes to cohabit that is first

of all to live

in cohesion first of all with me I

should not be I should not hear my ideas

my tribe is every

Try by every group has conflicts and we

learn to solve them without violence in

a healthy way and these skills help in

their couples

because when they start learning in the

tribe to communicate about that

when when they are able to manage

conflicts in a different way they take

that to their personal life then

um

we have also responded that the violence

is the opposite of

um

cohabiting being able to live together

this may be violence against oneself a

violence against another physical sexual

economic and emotional

balance emotional violence is the

business form of violence we have to

recognize how I emotionally

how I

am

what kind of emotional violence there is

we are able to prevent that or avoid

that because men learn to communicate

without violence or have a manage a

conflict without violence okay so what

are our five values

how can we move from violence to uh

Concord first of all emotional

vulnerability assertive the assertivity

that is in with respect are I stand on

my bounds but also respect somebody

else's opinion I look for them at Golden

means feedback this is the value both to

accept and to express dignity

we

try to learn not only

to ensure that it is good for me but

also for others my family my community

and playfulness this is another

value because the previous four

sound very serious and boring while

playfulness means that it's nice to be

here

humor is always

a good way to solve various issues of

life

what are future plans what are our

future plans I would like to mention

three things what we are thinking about

first we want to create International

tribes now we are working with the UK

and Ukraine we are trying to make sure

that we will be able uh to

help men in Ukraine create tribes and

our methodology will be translated into

Ukrainian soon then we have female

tribes

which we help create this is a quality

area for men therefore we understand

that females women also need such a

model and then mixed tribes of course it

is easiest to start speaking about that

within your gender tribe but it's not

necessary to close down it's much more

difficult to speak in a mixed group

there are many more triggers and it may

be more difficult to understand

to heal one another and understand but

this is possible of course we want to

engage in scientific research we

cooperate with colleagues from Village

University and other universities and we

expect to achieve something good what

are lessons and challenges

a few of them

is how to present the mental health in a

funny way and how to earn public trust

many people support us but we also hear

such

such comments as gay sex sexist losers

loser group we do business

from people's problems we speak about

women's problems too little uh we make

the agenda absolute and so on but we try

to communicate more about who we are and

very often we feel the lack of trust

then how do we help

men who are

a strong gun affected and of course

there's no time for all the ideas I

personally would like to create a good

course for men about suicides and help

in case of suicide and also about

domestic violence how can we help the

families where a man

um

is violent and how can we help men who

are exposed to violence

which uh messages do not help

one of these is that masculinity

stereotypes determine men's problem

uh as if men stick to their stereotypes

that's why they suffer but they suffer

due to various reasons like legal

inequality various social problems and

then we say that this is uh masculinity

which has to blame we blamed but yes

masculinity's stereotypes do have an

impact but this is not absolute

and plus uh this um

brings the controversy

this brings people into opposition

[Music]

then criticizing the traditional

masculinity and bullying it doesn't help

the term traditional masculinity is very

obscure we would Define traditional

masculinity very different way each of

us but the very well traditional is like

a negative word

and it also brings controversy into a

men's Circle they do not want to hear

about that because they

feel bad about that and the toxico

masculinity this term has been

criticized by researchers as a very bad

term

harmful term

men do not want to participate in gender

equality discourse when they hear a

toxic masculinity being mentioned if we

want to

have a man seeking for psychological

help participating in these discourses

we should not use it what what does help

speaking about very concrete problems

speaking about the True Values of the

traditional masculinity uh seeking

psychological

um

to solve psychological problems and

speaking about being brave to seek for

help being brave to solve your problems

instead of toxic let's speak about toxic

instead of toxic masculinity let's speak

about

um

the wrong Behavior like violence abuse

or bullies

self-destruction the result will be much

better

it's our experience and some ones about

men and suicides

I'm very happy

that I participate in different tribes

events and I'm approached by a different

man who say thank you thanks to to

tribes I haven't suicided for me it's

the best it's the best thing I could

hear

so a couple of things about suicides

we are blind towards the problems of men

if we only think about stereotypes they

do have their influence but it's not the

holistic view there are other things

that are very important for men other

thing many men lack emotional words for

expressing emotions but they can learn

that they learn that in tribes and

elsewhere

the topic of healthy anger is very

important many men engage in

self-destruction and tolerate

violence emotional violence and in this

way they move towards the

self-destruction and suicide is a very

important topic the Romantic

relationship it's a very vulnerable

topic many men lack

skills and for courtship for flirting

for maintaining a good relationship

there is very little information on that

all the information is somewhere hidden

and this sexual relationships

we do have much information about the

communication but but the sexuality this

topic lacks information at least for men

and this is important and many men

suffer because they lack information

it is also very important to know that

many men think I will be different I

won't be like my father we saw conflicts

among our parents and having a better

relationship with the mother we are at

our mother's side and now my clients in

the therapy my patients are trying to

get rid of this idea of being different

not being as their father and instead

looking for a more balanced approach to

to to themselves thank you I don't know

if I was too long but I wanted to tell

many things and I did

foreign

problems about what we

Define as good beings

as masculinity

we will have some time for questions

later we do have many questions

and

if we judge from the number of questions

so your presentation has aroused many

emotions ideas and wish to discuss a bit

later we will have some time for the

questions but now I say thank you

it is a good news

that you have started this project that

you want to contribute to the general

culture

that would help

your word

the coexistence

with yourself and with others I will

present

more people from the tribes we have here

some perseverance

men from the tribes who will share their

experience

being part of that tribe

hearing

[Music]

patinas he will speak about his

experience what it's been for him to be

a part of this project

yeah some good idea so Martinez you have

the floor

hello

thank you for inviting us

speaking about suicide and my experience

with the societal ideation

one of the stereotypes that I have

[Music]

a team is that even

a person usually tries to suicide

because of one event one problem this is

not true in my life there are many there

were many events or many problems my

mother got ill with cancer she died I

lost my job after seven years

and in my personal relationship with my

girlfriend

she

doesn't care about me anymore and she

decided to

to leave me

every of these

problems was like

a cold shower for me I didn't know how

to act in these situations

I didn't know what to do I was alone at

home after the funeral because my

girlfriend didn't want to to

be with me

I also lost my job I also was alone

after losing my job

and the only

solution in this situation for me was

suicide

what I noticed at this time

at that time was that the emotionals

thinking and The Logical thinking are

two different things if you speak about

emotions

I think that I nobody cares about me my

father my brother my friends do not care

about me

logically thinking I understand that I

am important for them they have their

routine their work they cannot be with

me all the time but I fell into

depression

it seemed to me that nobody cared about

me nobody loves me nobody needs me

I was afraid to seek help

and to speak for example with my father

or with my brother

the only thing that helped me was my

tribe

we had decided that no matter what

happens we meet each Thursday after work

it's always we talk how and like on

Thomas has presented we speak about uh

how I feel now what I have experienced

during this week

in My Tribe

I I forced myself into going to My Tribe

and said I had a knife on my table

yesterday and I was planning to cut

myself dead

but on the last minute I

texted my brother and changed my mind

but I would have done that my tribe

listened to me they I got lots of

attention and it was very valuable

I got lots of positive energy I felt

that I was important somebody cared

about that before I didn't feel that I

only knew that but when I was speaking

and they were listening to me in my

tribe I saw that I am important they

care and it is not so bad it is not so

dark in my life that the only solution

is

suicide

in our tribe

we had other men

who had had very strong

depression and depression thoughts and

the tribe

was that place where we came together

where we helped each other where we

stayed by one other side texting every

day speaking every day on form we are

eight men in the tribe so you can share

the this effort it's not

necessary to text that that eight people

that seven people text one person each

day but we just share this effort

yeah

one by one

I started taking medicine and to

depressants

and the tribe was my

my

things that saved me

sometimes

three or three o'clock in the morning

I'll call my tribe mate and tell him I

feel bad I need to talk and we would

talk and everything would come

to a good end so this is my experience

being a member of a tribe

and I really think that a tribe can help

a lot

even in suicide prevention now

I would like to present

other tribe made Andrei

and this together

hello

for introducing me I am Andreas

got involved in the tribal movement a

year ago

over a year ago

I grew up

in a family where

that is

my mom was trying to make me a real man

not like my late father because my

father was

sensitive and he was hiding his

emotionality

behind alcohol

and I decided that my family is going to

be different

if a few years ago I would have been

asked what was right and what was wrong

I had known what it meant to be a real

man I had my business I realized and I

did everything for my family for my

children

and at the psychological conference I

may say that a priest told me

how God is different from a surgeon

God knows really that he is not a

surgeon

and when my business started falling

apart and my self-realization

actually was based on my business

for the benefit of my children and my

family

I realized that I had no Foundation

under my feet

no support

when you know very well what is good and

when you lose it

then you have to look for other

Solutions

and one of the solutions and me being a

man I felt I have to solve it and I

thought that if there's no person then

there's no problem because I have huge

Ambitions I was greedy and it led

it it led to huge tension not only for

me but also for my family and I had a

question how all these my all these

business problems are going to affect my

family life

in Facebook I saw

that the rat tribe

fiestas and I decided to join I went

together with my son who was 13. he

didn't know about that and I actually

dragged him into that

and we spoke about that for the first

time very openly

and I we talked that there are various

moments in life

registration preview

over there there were more than 300 men

and one of the first objectives was to

speak in pairs to somebody whom I don't

know what is difficult for me in life

and I told him that my business was

going bankrupt

and he told me you know I've been

bankrupt since 2008 and now I manage my

finance but I have another problem

alcohol

so try not to repeat that out of 300

people I have found such

um a child member who had similar

problems amen

accepted my son as an equal

ity and I saw how they were reacting to

that how he was reacting to that it was

a meditation on the topic of a father so

I did my job regarding my father I cried

I um I had emotions and then I saw that

the same happened to my son then I

realized that this is the place I want

to be

I want my son to grow

and have a possibility to talk to men

and find Solutions and replies

and how will he choose that it will be

his decision

uh we went together

this summer he had his first

um

meeting during that Fiesta and it was

very important for me being a member of

the tribe gave me an understanding

in terms of

communication and Leadership

this is leadership which is based on

equal opportunities

men are with me and they have their

experiences their lives and

they are at one level

and they may be both weak and strong and

we can help each other this is different

yes

regularly and this regularity is also

important because

every week or three

um hours we speak about important things

things that matter to me I am also

participating at a facilitator as a

facilitator and this is a different

experience I see that I see that in

eight weeks people who have not known

each other come closer and start

speaking together about the issues which

are not convenient to them they start

drawing the line between what they want

and what they don't and undertake

responsibility for that for what they

receive from the third and what they

give

and they become

independent and and they take the

responsibility for their for the things

they receive which they give

and uh what they do this is my

experience

thank you Andre for a very personal

foreign

we will try to respond

to your questions we are very delighted

that um

right to respond to as many

questions as possible but there are many

questions so I hope that we will be able

to discuss them now together

hello again

I hope that this gang is ready to answer

a few important questions

everything you have shared has raised

many ideas and Impressions and for our

conference participants I'm not sure

close I will start with the following

questions

quite often we can hear negative

attitudes towards the tribe project

why do you think when this project

exists there's so much opposition to it

for instance recently Aurelia

publicized an article about the

masculinity crisis

I see a few reasons one is very clear

obvious much of distrust

because this is a very

fast growing project and we are not

always

um communicating about our activities

well

moreover this is emotionally a very

sensitive topic gender and masculinity

is a very painful aspect for all of us

also there are certain critical

observations about this project

which are correct because we are not

perfect and we have many people coming

to join us very injured or thinking

wrongly and of course they do various

wrongful feeds and then of course the

word spreads of course things happen in

these tribes and I said that there there

are radical male movements in the world

that's why we want men from these

radical movements uh to join us tribes

so that we are able to talk to each

other and

give feedback

of course

those men who come here do not

necessarily behave the way I would like

them to behave but I would like them to

stay in the dialogue and receive

feedback and be become better and better

members of our society

I think that the main thing is that

the public

has not yet

got much aware about that they have

stereotypes if this is a male group so

these are sexists there are many

wrongful thinking thoughts about that

the public opinion was formed by the

public at large rather than the

statements by the tribes themselves

we also have supportive comments

I am not a man but I'm really happy to

see a movement being developed which

helps men feel better and find a

positive masculinity example and there

are many messages like that is

also sending her support thank you for

tribes for your enthusiasm and many

ideas your activities are very important

and inspiring

when will I find a question

yes I got one

in relation to the presentation by The

Villa and the idea of the subjective

realization is the next understanding of

your masculine identity the question is

to Andre is what to you what masculinity

is to you how do you find it Puma well a

couple of years ago I was very much

convinced about what masculinity is

a man a businessman a real man

now I

am looking for this question in myself

what is masculinity

no what is masculinity when it is scary

when the war starts when I have to take

care of me my family

and actually can't have an impact of on

what is going on how can I

take care of myself when my business is

going down and I cannot explain to my

family why I am away from them and I

have to find

the ways to solve this problem rather

than just commit suicide those processes

and this is an eternal process

it's a constant relationship to myself

how do I feel

this is an attempt to solve these

questions in one or another way this is

about that

it's difficult to respond to this

question to me because in two years in

the tribes I understood a couple of

things I cannot name what masculinity is

and secondly I feel more and more

masculine so this is a contradiction

but

but I no longer struggle with that

am I masculine do I behave as a man this

is not no longer a problem for me

it is most important

and I will second

on that I am not clear about what

masculinity is but I feel masculine

virus and I know that when people say a

real man

they mean a mature pass

so these values are common values

uh and they refer to maturity a person

who can

manage his difficulties and to take a

responsibility for himself May manage

conflicts constructively looks for

Solutions this is related to maturity a

real man versus a boy an immature boy

who cannot undertake responsibility

but of course a mature person is not

only a mature man it's also a mature

woman

that's why we cannot explain what

masculinity is to me it is important to

be a mature individual rather than a

masculine man who can take care of

himself and his Kim

I am a heterosexual and to me it is

important how I get along with the other

the opposite gender can I create a good

relationship with her can I be a good

father

I showed you my picture

it was very difficult for me to realize

myself as a father I could not imagine

that I could have a child at that time I

didn't have a family now having talked

to many men who have families for

instance you Andre you to me are a

reputable person I now have a vision I

imagine how my family what my family

would look like and I feel the same as

other men and I am so delighted with

that Vision I want to move forward

towards that so this masculinity is very

important for me this is a relationship

to with another with the opposite agenda

okay

I was speaking about women in these

groups and and what times some people

may have various questions or some

concerns

many men in large

groups do not necessarily

demonstrate

and cause positive thoughts especially

when experience something negative how

is the woman the woman reflected and the

tribe if a man mentions the word woman

in the tribe then we accustom out from

the tribe now this is a joke of course

this is the major topic we are talking

about

this is one of the major topics

there are many

experiences and the age group is huge

from 18 year olds to

pensioners so we have many experiences

for instance my experience is that one

psychologist said that in 20 years of

common life with your wife was the wife

your life will be easier now it has been

20 years 21 that we have been living

together but it has not yet become

easier

but some people are divorced some

are

experiencing some painful situations now

with our wives Mothers Daughters

there are different experiences and we

share that

and to summarize

we speak about the opposite sex through

our experience what we had what what we

experienced what we learned and we what

we can how we can help others

in tribes men encourage each other to

speak about their personal experiences

rather than

philosophize we want to have deep

experiences

we don't want to speak about politics

theories and so on this has to be

practical what I feel what I experience

thank you very much

I think that our conference participants

have been able to

get more insights into what you do I

think that you speak about important

things that are necessary that that help

everyone discover their relationship

with masculinity however you define it

Define it or don't Define it

thank you very much for personal sharing

and professionals sharing and

for speaking about your future plans I

will now give the floor to polis and

then we will close
